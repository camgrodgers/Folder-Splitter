- write tests
	- Especially test filesize stuff
- write ReadMe.md
- documentation in comments?
- Gui?

Remaining functionality:
    - by date

Remaining options:
    - ignore directories
    - copy instead of move
    - zip compression?
	- multiple measurements of bytes for filesize arg

Errors:
	- crashes if there are already folders named '0' '1' etc
	- handle deliberate errors instead of unwrap
